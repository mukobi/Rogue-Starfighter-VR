		Xwing Alliance Sound Effects Upgrade Pack 1.0

 I have always loved Xwing Alliance, but most of the sound effects that
come with the game are just not very "Star Wars" sounding!
I saw what all the people in the XWA Upgrade community were doing and it
inspired me to make a few of my own modifications to improve this great
game. My goal here is to make it sound like you are part of the
Star Wars movies. I think that a great game or movie not only needs to
look like it will blow you away, but sound like it as well!

 I have filtered, tweaked, re-mixed, and recorded all of the sounds
myself from various Star Wars games, movies, and other media to give the
game a much more accurate "Star Wars" feel. This Mod will only work with
Hi-Res sounds turned on! Also, this mod is meant to be used with the 3D
sound enabled, but it is not required.

-----------------------------

Installation:

1. Go to where you have XWA installed on your drive and open the folder.

2. Simply extract this zip file into the main XWA folder and allow it to
   overwrite all the files.

3. Last, make sure you have XWA set up to use High Quality sounds in the
   game or you will only hear the default sounds. There are also several
   different sounds depending on if you have 3D sounds enabled or not.

4. That's it!
