  ~ Several folders and files have been renamed to shorten their names and make it easier to read (i.e., the folder named Snowspeeder has changed to T-47 Snowspeeder, and files inside this folder have changed names from "SNWSPDR" to simply "T-47". Hopefully this system will prove more effective.) Several sounds have also been renamed and reorganized, prioritizing higher quality samples.
