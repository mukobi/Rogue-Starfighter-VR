These are just my personal notes on how to bring the detuned A-wing
engine samples back to the original pitch, and a few other things here
and there. Just thought I'd include these for the fun of it so everyone
can tinker with it if they like. It's best to use Audacity for editing.

AW ENG 1C should be 48000 Hz. To reconstitute the sample, select samples
51,111 to the end, copy, delete, and paste to the beginning. It's a rough
reconstitution.

AW ENG 2B should be 15775 Hz.

AW ENG 2C should be 22050, offset 1097 samples.

AW ENG 2D should be 26200, offset 1300 samples.

AW ENG 3 series should be 35915.

The sample from Star Wars: Battle Pod (AW-BW ENG 2A) is at 48000 hz. Offset is 2382.
The in-game loop section is between 48080 and 308974 samples.

To recreate the XVT sample (AW-BW ENG 1D) with the Star Wars: Battle Pod sample
(AW-BG ENG 2A), offset the left channel from the right by 1726 samples and
invert it. Only the segments that overlap are useful (the selection between 1726
samples and 336768 samples.) Crop to this selection, and mix down to mono. Take the
resulting sound and layer it on top of itself, but offset one layer by 2382 samples.
Invert the offset layer. It perfectly recreates the A-wing engine sample used in
Star Wars: X-wing VS TIE Fighter, just a longer and higher quality sample. I
compared it with the original by the sample, and it's a near perfect match. It's
almost scary just how accurate a recreation it is.
