These custom stereo samples emulate the 'flutter' effect heard in the
A-wing engine sample from Star Wars: X-wing vs. TIE Fighter (AW-BW ENG 1D)
originally released in 1997. This effect is achieved by layering the
sample over itself, offsetting one layer by approximately 0.49625 seconds,
and inverting the offset layer. Just mix these down to 'mono' using Audacity
to hear the result.
